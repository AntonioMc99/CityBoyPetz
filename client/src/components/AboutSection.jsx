          We are Carl and Shanice Stephens, the owners of City Boy Petz Mobile Petting Zoo. We started this business because we love animals and we love seeing kids light up when they get to touch, hold, and interact with them. Our top priority is creating a safe, hands-on experience where children can truly connect with our friendly animals.

With years of experience caring for kid-approved pets, we make sure every visit is interactive, educational, and unforgettable. We focus on safety, cleanliness, and making sure each child feels confident and excited while exploring the animals up close.

Whether it’s a birthday party, school event, community day, or a special surprise, City Boy Petz brings a hands-on adventure straight to you, filled with learning, laughter, and animals your kids will love.

City Boy Petz is where every event becomes an experience they’ll never forget.
